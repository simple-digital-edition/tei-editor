A\n//   single rule should have _either_ a `tag` or a `style` property.\n//\n//   namespace:: ?string\n//   The namespace to match.

May also have the form\n//   `\"property=value\"`, in which case the rule only matches if the\n//   propery's value exactly matches the given value.

Should contain one or more node\n//   names or node group names followed by single or double slashes.\n//   For example `\"paragraph/\"` means the rule only matches when the\n//   parent node is a paragraph, `\"blockquote/paragraph/\"` restricts\n//   it to be in a paragraph that is inside a blockquote, and\n//   `\"section//\"` matches any position inside a section—a double\n//   slash matches any sequence of ancestor nodes. To allow multiple\n//   different contexts, they can be separated by a pipe (`|`)\n//   character, as in `\"blockquote/|list_item/\"`.\n//\n//   node:: ?string\n//   The name of the node type to create when this rule matches. Only\n//   valid for rules with a `tag` property, not for style rules. Each\n//   rule should have one of a `node`, `mark`, or `ignore` property\n//   (except when it appears in a [node](#model.NodeSpec.parseDOM) or\n//   [mark spec](#model.MarkSpec.parseDOM), in which case the `node`\n//   or `mark` property will be derived from its position).\n//\n//   mark:: ?string\n//   The name of the mark type to wrap the matched content in.\n//\n//   ignore:: ?bool\n//   When true, ignore content that matches this rule.\n//\n//   closeParent:: ?bool\n//   When true, finding an element that matches this rule will close\n//   the current node.\n//\n//   skip:: ?bool\n//   When true, ignore the node that matches this rule, but do parse\n//   its content.\n//\n//   attrs:: ?Object\n//   Attributes for the node or mark created by this rule. When\n//   `getAttrs` is provided, it takes precedence.\n//\n//   getAttrs:: ?(union<dom.Node, string>) → ?union<Object, false>\n//   A function used to compute the attributes for the node or mark\n//   created by this rule. Can also be used to describe further\n//   conditions the DOM element or style must match. When it returns\n//   `false`, the rule won't match. When it returns null or undefined,\n//   that is interpreted as an empty/default set of attributes.\n//\n//   Called with a DOM Element for `tag` rules, and with a string (the\n//   style's value) for `style` rules.\n//\n//   contentElement:: ?union<string, (dom.Node) → dom.Node>\n//   For `tag` rules that produce non-leaf nodes or marks, by default\n//   the content of the DOM element is parsed as content of the mark\n//   or node. If the child nodes are in a descendent node, this may be\n//   a CSS selector string that the parser must use to find the actual\n//   content element, or a function that returns the actual content\n//   element to the parser.\n//\n//   getContent:: ?(dom.Node, schema: Schema) → Fragment\n//   Can be used to override the content of a matched node. When\n//   present, instead of parsing the node's child nodes, the result of\n//   this function is used.\n//\n//   preserveWhitespace:: ?union<bool, \"full\">\n//   Controls whether whitespace should be preserved when parsing the\n//   content inside the matched element. `false` means whitespace may\n//   be collapsed, `true` means that whitespace should be preserved\n//   but newlines normalized to spaces, and `\"full\"` means that\n//   newlines should also be preserved.\n\n// ::- A DOM parser represents a strategy for parsing DOM content into\n// a ProseMirror document conforming to a given schema.
